## Recommendation: dual-license — **AGPLv3 OR Commercial**

License the open **Community Edition** under **AGPLv3**, and offer a separate
**Commercial license** for anyone who can't accept copyleft.

- **Why AGPL:** its network-use clause (§13) stops a cloud provider from hosting a
  competing SaaS clone without contributing back, while remaining genuine OSI
  open source that drives adoption and trust.
- **Why dual:** the commercial license is the built-in monetization lever and the
  escape hatch for enterprises with "no-AGPL" policies.
- **Main trade-off:** AGPL deters some enterprises (smaller top-of-funnel) in
  exchange for protection + a clean upsell. **Plan B:** BUSL (source-available,
  time-delayed open-source conversion) if you want to outright forbid competing
  hosted use; **Apache-2.0** if raw adoption outweighs protection.

## License options compared

| License | Copyleft / network clause | Competitor can host as SaaS? | Friendly to paid hosted edition? | Adoption friction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AGPLv3** | Strong + network (§13) | Must open their changes | Yes (via dual-license) | Medium |
| Apache-2.0 / MIT | None | Freely | Weakest protection | Lowest |
| PolyForm Noncommercial | Bans all commercial use | No | N/A (not OSS) | High for adopters |
| BUSL / source-available | Time-delayed → OSS later | No (until Change Date) | Strong | Medium-High |
| **Dual (AGPL OR Commercial)** | AGPL by default | Not without a commercial license | **Best fit** | Medium |

## Community vs Pro boundary

| Community (free, self-host) | Pro (paid / hosted) |
|---|---|
| Core CRM, deals, projects, finance tracker | Hosted multi-tenant SaaS |
| Dashboard, template library | Advanced AI agents + automation packs |
| Single org, owner/admin/member | Real multi-org UX, SSO, advanced RBAC |
| n8n webhook hooks | Client portal, white-label |
| | FlowAccount/PEAK/Xero accounting integrations |
| | Support / SLA |

**Principle:** protect the *hosting and advanced automation*, not the basics.
Keep the seams clean in V1 (the `org_id` everywhere + module boundaries already
do this) so the split is repackaging, not a rewrite.

## Open-core hygiene

- Keep Pro-only code out of the open repo (a separate private repo or an `ee/`
  package with its own license).
- Adopt a **CLA from day one** — a DCO alone can't support relicensing for the
  dual-license model.
- Treat **"ABA Energy" as an unlicensed trademark**: register the word mark in
  Thailand and require forks to rebrand.
